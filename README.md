## EOG React Assessment


The primary goal is to create a working dashboard which visualizes the real time and historical values of a hypothetical set of equipment in the field. The equipment publishes its data every 1.3 seconds.

BTW: historical means "charting" the last 30 minutes of data, and realtime means displaying it prominently. (So one could scan the page and see the current value).
